### Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.svg" width="280" />
</p>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_supplier 1`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.svg" width="650" />
</p>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ComponentManagers.svg" width="300" />
</p>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackr/ui/Ui.java)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/UiClassDiagram.svg" />
</p>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TabPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackr/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Order`, `Task` or `Menu` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.svg" width="550"/>
</p>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TrackrParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object, which is actually an object of one of its subclasses, for example `AddItemCommand`, which is actually also an object of one of its subclasses, for example `AddOrderCommand`. This specific command will then be executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an order).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete_order 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_order 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteOrderCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ParserClasses.svg" width="600"/>
</p>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TrackrParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddOrderCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddOrderCommand`) which the `TrackrParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddOrderCommandParser`, `DeleteOrderCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackr/model/Model.java)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.svg" width="450" />
</p>

The `Model` component,

* `XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific object (e.g., `Supplier`, `Task`), which are all `Item` objects.
* stores trackr data i.e., all `XYZ` objects (contained in respective `UniqueXYZList` object).
* stores currently 'selected' `XYZ` objects (e.g., results of search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<XYZ>` that can be viewed (e.g. UI bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

Here is the `Item` class that is what all model objects depend on.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/ItemClassDiagram.svg" width="300" />
</p>

Each `ItemList` contains a `UniqueItemList` that stores a list of unique `Items`, which are defined by a model definiton (e.g., `Supplier` or `Task` from `ModelEnum`).


This is the class representation for the `Supplier` and `Customer` class.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/PersonClassDiagram.svg" width="500" />
</p>

Here is how `Supplier` and `Customer` works:

* `Supplier` and `Customer` inherit off `Person` class, which depends on the `Item` class.
* Each `Person` contains their name, phone number, deadline, email and tags. (e.g., `PersonAddress` represents the address)
* The `Supplier` and `Customer` object have their corresponding `List` and `UniqueList` that stores their information.

This is the class representation for the `Task` class.

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/TaskClassDiagram.svg" width="450" />
</p>

Here is how `Task` works:

* Each `Task` contains their description, deadline and status (e.g., `TaskName` for task name).
* Each of the attributes inherits off the corresponding `common` classes (e.g., `TaskName` inherit off `Name`).
* The `Task` object have its `List` and `UniqueList`.

This is the class representation for the `Menu` class.

<p align ="center">
   <img src="images/MenuClassDiagram.svg" width="450" />
 </p>

Here is how `Menu` works:

* Each `Menu` contains non-negative and non-zero number of `MenuItem`.
* Each `MenuItem` contains their description, price and cost (e.g., `ItemName` for menu's item name).
* The `MenuItem`'s `ItemName` attribute inherit off the corresponding `common` classes (e.g., `ItemName` inherit off `Name`).
* The `MenuItem` object have its `List` called `Menu` and `UniqueList`.
* The `MenuItem` is an attribute of `Order`

This is the class representation for the `Order` class.

<p align ="center">
   <img src="images/OrderClassDiagram.svg" width="550" />
 </p>

Here is how `Order` works:

* Each `OrderList` contains non-negative and non-zero number of `Order`.
* Each `Order` contains a menu item, customer, quantity, status and deadline (e.g., `OrderStatus` for order's status).
* The menu item and customer each contains attributes as mentioned in their respective section above on how `Menu` and `Customer` works.
* The `Order`'s `OrderDeadlne` and `OrderStatus` attribute inherit off the corresponding `common` classes (e.g., `OrderDeadline` inherit off `Deadline`).
* The `Order` object have its `List` called `OrderList` and `UniqueList`.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/trackr/storage/Storage.java)

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.svg" width="750" />
</p>

The `Storage` component,

* can save both trackr data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TrackrStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `trackr.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes the details on how the common commands are implemented.

The commands would be in the format `<action>XYZCommand`, where `XYZ` represents suppliers, customers, orders, menu items and tasks while `action` represents the action of the command.

### AddXYZCommand

The `add` command creates and add object `XYZ` into `XYZList` and `FilteredXYZList`.It also saves into the internal `XYZList`, which stores all the `XYZ` objects, that matches the provided keywords.

The keywords that can be provided are the attributes as seen in the corresponding `XYZ`'s class diagram.
For example, `n/` would be followed by a task name for `AddTaskCommand` and order name for `AddSupplierCommand`.

The parser for the `add` command would extract out the arguments corresponding to each particular field.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the `add` command.

 <p align="center">
     <img src="images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.svg">
 </p>

### DeleteXYZCommand

The `delete` command removes an `XYZ` from internal `FilteredXYZList`.

The command only accepts 1 argument without any prefixes. The argument corresponds to the index of `XYZ` in the `FilteredXYZList` that the user wishes to delete using a one-based index.

The parser for `delete` command extracts the index found in the arguments. If the argument is valid, then zero-based index is used to remove `XYZ` from the `XYZList`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the `delete` command.

 <p align="center">
     <img src="images/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.svg">
 </p>

### Edit feature

The `edit` command edits item `XYZ` from the internal `XYZList`.

This command requires user to key in the index of the item they wish to edit.

Edit supplier, edit order and edit task features are implemented using the same edit mechanism as described in this section.

The `EditXYZCommandParser#parse()` is used to parse the given command.

If the given command is valid, an `EditXYZCommand` will be returned and `EditXYZCommand#execute()` will then be called.

`EditXYZCommand#execute()` will first retrieve that latest filtered XYZ list from the model and check if the index given is valid.

If the given index is valid, item at given index will be retrieved. A copy of the item retrieved will be made and edited accordingly.

If changes to the original item is made and edited item is not the same as another existing item in the list,
the edited item is saved to the filtered list and `EditXYZCommand#execute()` will return the `CommandResult`

Lastly, Changes made are saved to local data and success message will be shown.

 <p align="center">
    <img src="images/EditCommandActivityDiagram.svg" width="900" />
</p>

### FindXYZCommand

The `find` command finds objects `XYZ` from the internal `XYZList`, which stores all the `XYZ` objects, that matches the provided keywords.

The keywords that can be provided are the same as those provided during the `add` and `edit` command.
For example, `n/` would represent a task name for `FindTaskCommand` and order name for `FindSupplierCommand`.

The parser for the `find` command would extract out the arguments corresponding to each particular field.

A `XYZContainsKeywordPredicate` is built upon these fields, which is used to test each `XYZ` object in the `XYZList` on whether they match the keywords provided.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the `find` command.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.svg">
</p>

### ListXYZCommand

The `list` command lists all the `XYZ` objects in the internal `FilteredXYZList`.

The command retrieves all the `XYZ` objects from the `XYZList` and places them in the `FilteredXYZList`.

The `FilteredXYZList` is then updated to have all `XYZ` objects, it will then to shown to the user.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the user executes the `list` command.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ListCommandActivityDiagram.svg">
</p>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTrackr`. It extends `Trackr` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as a `trackrStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTrackr#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current trackr state in its history.
* `VersionedTrackr#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous trackr state from its history.
* `VersionedTrackr#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone trackr state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitTrackr()`, `Model#undoTrackr()` and `Model#redoTrackr()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedTrackr` will be initialized with the initial trackr state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single trackr state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.svg)

Step 2. The user executes `delete_task 5` command to delete the 5th task in the trackr. The `delete_task` command calls `Model#commitTrackr()`, causing the modified state of the trackr after the `delete_task 5` command executes to be saved in the `trackrStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted trackr state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.svg)

Step 3. The user executes `add_task n/Sort Storage â€¦â€‹` to add a new task. The `add_task` command also calls `Model#commitTrackr()`, causing another modified trackr state to be saved into the `trackrStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.svg)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitTrackr()`, so the trackr state will not be saved into the `trackrStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoTrackr()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous trackr state, and restores the trackr to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.svg)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Trackr state, then there are no previous Trackr states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoTrackr()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.svg)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoTrackr()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the trackr to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `trackrStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest trackr state, then there are no undone Trackr states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoTrackr()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list_task`. Commands that do not modify the trackr, such as `list_task`, will usually not call `Model#commitTrackr()`, `Model#undoTrackr()` or `Model#redoTrackr()`. Thus, the `trackrStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.svg)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitTrackr()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `trackrStateList`, all trackr states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add_task n/Sort Storage â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.svg)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.svg" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Documentation, logging, testing, configuration, dev-ops**

* [Documentation guide](Documentation.md)
* [Testing guide](Testing.md)
* [Logging guide](Logging.md)
* [Configuration guide](Configuration.md)
* [DevOps guide](DevOps.md)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Tech-savvy small businesses owners who:
    * lists their products online or on their own website
    * perform transactions manually without a Point-of-Sale (POS) system
    * Lack manpower/ time to track orders and contacts manually
    * Has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* Prefer desktop apps over other types
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using _CLI_ apps

**Value proposition**:

Our application:
* allows for consolidation of orders, contacts & tasks information which makes it easier to manage them. (no real-time automation)
* serves as a user-friendly alternative to free applications such as Microsoft Excel which may not be catered to their needs and requires tedious formatting. (no support for custom format of interface)
* enables faster contact management compared to a typical mouse/_GUI_ driven app

### User stories

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `Trackr` and the **Actor** is the `Small Business Owner`)

**Use case: UC01 - Add a new supplier**

MSS

1. Actor requests to add a new supplier.
2. Actor enters a command to add a supplier with the required information.
3. Trackr saves the new supplier to the system.
4. Trackr shows the new supplier added to the list.

   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 2a. The Actor does not enter all required information.
